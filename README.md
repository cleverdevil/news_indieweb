# Nextcloud News IndieWeb Plugin

[Nextcloud News](http://github.com/nextcloud/news) is an excellent feed
aggregator and reader for [Nextcloud](http://www.nextcloud.com). This plugin is
an extension to Nextcloud News that enables [Indieweb](http://indieweb.org)
interactions with articles.

Using this plugin, you can create replies, likes, reposts, and bookmarks on your
[Micropub](https://micropub.net) compatible website. This plugin leverages the
excellent [Quill](http://quill.p3k.io) Micropub client to enable interactions.

## Installation

Simply clone this repository into your `nextcloud/apps` directory and enable the
app. While this is technically a "plugin" for the Nextcloud News app, it
installs and is managed just like a first class application.
